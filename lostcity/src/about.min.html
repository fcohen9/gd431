My husband and I drive 30+ minutes and deal with Baltimore parking to get the vegan burgers, VLTs, and veggie chik'n sandwiches. They are the bomb! And you can get real old-fashioned malts and ice cream sodas in non-dairy form. The vegan tin roofs are sooo good! And the decor is cool. Hubby is a big sci-fi geek and I love old campy movies, so there's something for both of us :) If you like diner food and you're a vegan or vegetarian, please give this place a try - and just make sure you're not in a huge hurry.</p><h6 class="reviewers">Amy M:</h6><p class="reviews">When our train was delayed we decided to walk here for a cup of coffee. We had no idea the whole place was 1950s b-horror movie themed. The inside is decorated with vintage movie posters and electronic equipment, and they have a free working jukebox playing all of the music. Our server was Jazmin and I'm so glad that she was. She took the time to chat with us through our time there, and while there she was trying a new pumpkin spice milkshake and gave us all samples to see what we thought- SO GOOD! Should be added to the menu. Like I said we just stopped in for drinks, but she made all of them beautifully presented. All the food passing us by looked great, we all said we were sorry we had already eaten. Will come again next time I'm in Baltimore!</p></div><div class="slideshow__about"><div class="slideshow__about--container"><img class="mySlides" src="/images/fries.svg" alt="fries"> <img class="mySlides" src="/images/milkshake.svg" alt="milkshake"> <img class="mySlides" src="/images/burger.svg" alt="burger"> <button class="button__slideshow" onclick="plusDivs(-1)">&#10094;</button> <button class="button__slideshow" onclick="plusDivs(1)">&#10095;</button></div></div></div>
