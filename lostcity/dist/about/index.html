        <p class="reviews">Full disclosure: I've only ever come here on weekends when the place hasn't been
            overwhelmingly busy, so service has always been pretty good. My husband and I drive 30+ minutes and deal
            with
            Baltimore parking to get the vegan burgers, VLTs, and veggie chik'n sandwiches. They are the bomb! And you
            can
            get
            real old-fashioned malts and ice cream sodas in non-dairy form. The vegan tin roofs are sooo good!

            And the decor is cool. Hubby is a big sci-fi geek and I love old campy movies, so there's something for
            both of
            us
            :) If you like diner food and you're a vegan or vegetarian, please give this place a try - and just make
            sure
            you're not in a huge hurry.</p>

        <p class="reviews">When our train was delayed we decided to walk here for a cup of coffee. We had no idea the
            whole place
            was
            1950s
            b-horror movie themed. The inside is decorated with vintage movie posters and electronic equipment, and
            they
            have a
            free working jukebox playing all of the music. Our server was Jazmin and I'm so glad that she was. She took
            the
            time to chat with us through our time there, and while there she was trying a new pumpkin spice milkshake
            and
            gave
            us all samples to see what we thought- SO GOOD! Should be added to the menu. Like I said we just stopped in
            for
            drinks, but she made all of them beautifully presented. All the food passing us by looked great, we all
            said we
            were sorry we had already eaten. Will come again next time I'm in Baltimore!</p>
